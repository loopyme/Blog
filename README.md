# Blog
Theme clone from:
 - https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io
 - https://github.com/qiubaiying/qiubaiying.github.io

> Old blog repository is [here](https://github.com/loopyme/archive_blog) ,which currently has been archived and re-uploaded by [this commit](https://github.com/loopyme/loopyme.github.io/commit/5e6e07ffd8f1e343832619c7ba84173bb1146e92). Re-uploaded is not elegant,but I think using theme repositories is not actually a fork and re-uploaded is the way to remove the fork mark.

Currently host on Aliyun-OSS.
